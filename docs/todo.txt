Refactor

separate backend code from frontend code

use layout file and content
-(and keep request file with html?
-it would be nice to have something like FRONTEND_layout()
-and then the html content code below
-chatgpt: ob_start() -> html content code -> $content = ob_get_clean() -> include layout.php)

UI

make ui wider (64rem?)
make ui work on mobile (maybe later if it's too much)

...

use SQL_functions
