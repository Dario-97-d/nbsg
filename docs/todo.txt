-- TODO --

DATA

use char id instead of username for mail
use mail msg state(s?) viewed/deleted instead of seen in { 0, 1, 2 }, for clarity
rename long sql fields
- training_sessions_for_upgrade -> attribute_points
- sessions_needed_for_upgrade   -> points_needed
- OR: use attribute_points and not points_needed

LATER

Add logging.
Build a robust set of SQL functions.
- Hide sensitive data (sql connection credentials).
- Use prepared statements.
- Replace tabs and multi space for 1 whitespace in sql query string value.
Update validation logic, maybe add HANDLE functions for input like return [ is_valid:bool, handled:string, message:string ].
- or use references and change value.
Add extensive checks and feedback messages for all Actions.
Use file for file paths constants.

MINOR

maybe use preffix _ for in-file function use

CONCEPT

Drop Clan/Style
maybe use something like Lineage or Spirit instead of Clan and Style, for non-ambiguity
- or maybe just drop it altogether, for free char development
Change calculation of bots' skills in team exam
- maybe drop bots and do something else.
- maybe have teams fight each other or any existing team, including passed.

...

use SQL_functions from FBP (?)
